# Tennis Reservation Project Summary

## Completed Features

*   **Web Application (Flask `app.py`):** 
    *   Main application handling web requests, routing, and template rendering.
    *   Integrates various modules for different functionalities.
*   **Data Models (`models.py`):** 
    *   Defines data structures for `Court`, `UserInformation` (likely replacing initial User model), and `BookingAttempt`.
*   **Database Interaction (`database.py`):**
    *   Initializes and manages data persistence (details of storage mechanism need confirmation - likely JSON or simple DB).
*   **User Information Management:**
    *   `/settings` route to input and save user credentials and preferences (`UserInformation` model).
    *   Loads latest user info for display.
*   **Court Scraping (`court_scraper.py`):**
    *   `update_court_list` function to fetch available courts.
    *   Functionality to sync scraped courts with the database (`Court` model).
    *   Routes for manual refresh (`/courts/refresh`) and debugging (`/courts/debug`).
*   **Booking Scheduling & Automation:**
    *   `/schedule-booking` route to accept booking requests.
    *   Creates `BookingAttempt` records.
    *   Integrates with `automation.py` (likely containing `TennisBooker` class) for executing booking logic.
    *   Uses a scheduler (`scheduler.py`/`extensions.py`) for timed booking attempts.
*   **Templates:** 
    *   HTML templates for the main page (`index.html`), settings (`settings.html`), etc.
*   **(Legacy User Management):** 
    *   Initial functions to save/load users to `users.json` (Potentially superseded by `UserInformation` model and `database.py`).

## Features to Add

1.  **Data Encryption:** Implement encryption for sensitive user data (passwords, phone numbers) stored via `UserInformation` model.
    *   *Priority: High (Security). Essential for protecting PII.*
2.  **Password Hashing/Authentication:** Securely handle user passwords during login/authentication (currently stores plaintext password in `UserInformation`).
    *   *Priority: High (Security). Must be addressed before handling real user data.*
3.  **Refine Error Handling & Logging:** Improve error handling and add more detailed logging throughout the application.
    *   *Priority: Medium. Improves stability and maintainability, can be done incrementally.*
4.  **Review `phone_verification_endpoint.py`:** Understand its purpose and integration (not seen in `app.py` yet).
    *   *Priority: High. Need to understand existing code before building further.*
5.  **Review `user_manager.py`:** Understand its role, especially in relation to `UserInformation` model. 
    *   *Priority: High. Need to clarify user management approach and avoid redundancy.* 
6.  **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement checks on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS).
    *   *Priority: High. Essential for security.*
7.  **CSRF Protection:** Add Cross-Site Request Forgery protection, especially for forms.
    *   *Priority: High. Standard web security measure.*
8.  **HTTPS Enforcement (Deployment):** Confirm HTTPS is automatically handled by Render.com deployment.
    *   *Priority: High. Critical for encrypting traffic.*
9.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement request limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks.
    *   *Priority: Medium. Good protection against automated attacks.*
10. **Security Headers:** Add HTTP security headers (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`).
    *   *Priority: Medium. Enhance browser-level security.*
11. **Authorization/Access Control:** Implement checks to ensure users can only access appropriate data/actions (if roles are introduced).
    *   *Priority: Medium (Depends on feature expansion). Important if admin roles are formalized.*

## Nice to Have Features

1.  **User Notifications:** Add a notification system for users (e.g., booking success/failure).
    *   *Priority: Low. Useful for user experience but not essential for core functionality.*
2.  **Fetch Specific User:** Implement functionality to retrieve and display details for a single user (potentially using `UserInformation` model).
    *   *Priority: Low. Enhancement for admin/user management, can be deferred.*
